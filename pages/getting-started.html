			<h2>New to Martial Arts?</h2>
			<p>If you've never done martial arts before, attending a martial arts class for the first time can seem like a scary prospect! But it doesn't need to be.</p>
			<p>Our teaching atmosphere is designed to make it easy for newcomers to martial arts. We strive to cultivate a culture of mutual respect between students, their peers and instructors. We don't employ severe discipline or military training methods, because we don't need to; our collaborative and supportive culture will make them <i>want</i> improve and be the best they can - and there is no substitute for that kind of motivation.</p>
			<p>As you start out, we'll tailor your training to you, to make sure all of the exercises are of an appropriate difficulty. We'll also check in with you before and after classes to make sure you're finding everything manageable.</p>

			<h2>Got Previous Experience?</h2>
			<p>If you have previous martial arts experience, you're also welcome at Rise Taekwon-Do!</p>
			<p>Those who have practiced other martial arts in the past (or are still practicing them) will find that although the techniques are different, many skills will be transferable to Taekwon-Do - especially the skill of being a good learner, which is the most valuable of all for progression in any martial art. Such students will need to start from white belt in ITF Taekwon-Do, but will likely make fast progress due to their prior experience.</p>
			<p>Existing ITF Taekwon-Do practitioners are also welcome, and will be able to maintain their current grade as they join Rise Taekwon-Do. We ask that any students already training at existing clubs please seek the permission of their instructors before attending - we don't poach students.</p>

			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p></p>
			<h3>Do I need to be fit to join a Taekwon-Do class?</h3>
			<p>You're putting the cart before the horse - you'll get fit <i>by</i> joining a Taekwon-Do class.</p>
			<p>At Rise Taekwon-Do, we don't require any pre-existing level of fitness or physical ability. Our instructor will tailor the level of training according to your ability, and if you're not able to complete an exercise, you'll be given a modified exercise more suitable to you. What's important is that you're training to <i>your own</i> limits, not those imposed by others.</p>
			<h3>Will I get injured if I train in Taekwon-Do?</h3>
			<p>Under a responsible instructor, injuries are rare and usually minor. While you might get the odd bruise or scrape, you certainly won't be going home with black eyes and bloody noses each week.</p>
			<h3>Do I have to attend competitions if I train at Rise Taekwon-Do?</h3>
			<p>We encourage our more senior students to attend some competitions (even if only internal ones), as there is no better place to test how your Taekwon-Do skills hold up when you leave the comfort of your class and put yourself under pressure. New or lower-grade students are also welcome to participate if they'd like.</p>
			<h3>Will Taekwon-Do make my child violent?</h3>
			<p>One of the core components of Taekwon-Do (and indeed any martial art) - is the development of discipline and maturity. While martial arts do improve students' fighting skills, they also build the self-control and restraint required to possess those skills and still behave responsibly. Your child won't suddenly become more aggressive after training in the martial arts - if anything, the opposite is more likely.</p>
			<h3>Do I need to buy a uniform right away?</h3>
			<p>Our uniforms, known as <i>doboks</i>, are designed to be the most comfortable clothes to train in, so you'll want to get one eventually. You're welcome to wear your own clothes to class while starting out, but you'll need an ITF dobok in order to attend a grading or any other event besides classes.</p>
			<h3>My question wasn't answered here.</h3>
			<p>You're welcome to reach out to us with any further queries you may have!</p>
