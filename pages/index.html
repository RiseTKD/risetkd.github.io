			<h2>Schools and Classes</h2>
			<p>We currently operate one Taekwon-Do school in Finchley, with more to come in future.</p>
			<p>At Rise Taekwon-Do, we run two kinds of classes, to make sure we cater to everyone. Family classes are open to anyone aged 8 or over, and provide a training experience suitable for younger students and family groups. Meanwhile, advanced classes only accept those aged 13 or more, and feature more challenging training.</p>
