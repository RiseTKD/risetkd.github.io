			<h2>What is Taekwon-Do?</h2>
			<p>Taekwon-Do, which literally translates as <i>"the art of hand and foot"</i>, is a Korean martial art known especially for its impressive kicks. Taking inspiration from Karate and traditional Korean martial arts like Taekkyon, Taekwon-Do was initially developed in the 1950s by General Choi Hong Hi (9<sup>th</sup> degree), known as the Father of Taekwon-Do, and the other pioneers. Since then, it has spread outward from Korea and is now taught across the globe.</p>

			<h2>Our Instructor</h2>
			<p>At the age of just 10, Daniel Beard (3<sup>rd</sup> degree) started his training under Grand Master Nardizzi (9<sup>th</sup> degree) at Taekwon-Do Impact's Kensington class. Taekwon-Do quickly became a central part of his life and since then, he has trained in the art continuously, throughout both school and university. After attaining a degree in Computer Science from Imperial, Daniel decided that Taekwon-Do is where his heart lies, which led him to founding Rise Taekwon-Do in 2024, to pass his love for the martial art on to others.</p>
			<p>Since the pandemic, he has also become a regular member of the Impact Squad, attending numerous Taekwon-Do competitions each year across the country and in Europe. He is currently the adult England Champion for 3<sup>rd</sup> degree patterns, having won gold at the 2024 English National Championships.</p>

			<h2>About the ITF</h2>
			<p>Through Impact, Rise Taekwon-Do is affiliated with the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). Founded in 1966 by Choi Hong-Hi, the ITF is the body responsible for overseeing the practice of Taekwon-Do worldwide. It sets and enforces the standards for teaching, training and competing, with the aim of ensuring consistency across the globe. The ITF provides advanced training courses for senior black belts, sets the competition rules that most tournaments adhere to and licenses its instructors to teach, but does not take a direct involvement in students' training.</p>
			<p>Our local branch of the ITF, called ITF England, plays a larger role in the day-to-day lives of students. In addition to facilitating cooperation between Taekwon-Do clubs in England, ITF England hosts its own competitions and seminars. These are open to all members of affiliated associations, including Rise Taekwon-Do students. In addition, for those with ambitions in the competitive side of Taekwon-Do, ITF England is responsible for selecting athletes for the national squad, who represent England in the European and World Championships.</p>
