		<h2>About Taekwon-Do Impact</h2>
		<p>Rise Taekwon-Do is a proud member of Taekwon-Do Impact, a London-based association comprised of over 20 schools and clubs. Founded by Grand Master Donato Nardizzi (9<sup>th</sup> degree) in 1996, Impact is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving and proliferating the teaching of Taekwon-Do, by streamlining admin and minimising fees. By taking this burden off the shoulders of its schools, Impact enables its instructors to focus on the more important aspects of running a Taekwon-Do school, namely providing a safe training environment and high-quality teaching for their students.</p>
		<p>There's more to Impact than just paperwork, though; we're a community. As members of Taekwon-Do Impact, Rise Taekwon-Do students have access to frequent events such as seminars and mini-competitions, where they can test their abilities and learn from some of Impact's many highly-experienced instructors, including our Grand Master (9<sup>th</sup> degree) and two Masters (8<sup>th</sup> degrees). Additionally, the head coach Jason Ogden (4<sup>th</sup> degree) runs monthly squad training for the Impact Team, who regularly compete in tournaments at the national and international level. Finally, there's the Impact Open, our annual competition where the whole Impact family comes together to host a huge, day-long tournament with hundreds of entrants both from within Impact and from without!</p>

		<h2>About the ITF</h2>
		<p>Through Impact, Rise Taekwon-Do is affiliated with the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). Founded in 1966 by the Father of Taekwon-Do, General Choi Hong-Hi (9<sup>th</sup> degree), the ITF is the body responsible for overseeing the practice of Taekwon-Do worldwide, setting and enforcing the standards for teaching, training and competing. This is done with the aim of ensuring that Taekwon-Do is taught and performed consistently across the globe, and in accordance with Choi's vision for the art. The ITF provides advanced training courses for senior black belts, sets the competition rules that most tournaments adhere to and licenses its instructors to teach, but does not take a direct involvement in students' training.</p>
		<p>Our local branch of the ITF, called ITF England, plays a larger role in the day-to-day training of our students. In addition to facilitating cooperation and communication between Taekwon-Do associations within England, of which Impact is just one of many, ITF England also hosts its own competitions and seminars, which are open to members of affiliated associations, including Rise Taekwon-Do students. In addition, for those with ambitions in the competitive side of Taekwon-Do, ITF England is responsible for selecting athletes for the national squad, who represent England in the European and World Championships.</p>
