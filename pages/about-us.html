			<h2>What is Taekwon-Do (TKD)?</h2>
			<p>Taekwon-Do, which literally translates as <i>"the art of hand and foot"</i>, is a Korean martial art known especially for its impressive kicks. Taking inspiration from Karate and traditional Korean martial arts like Taekkyon, Taekwon-Do was initially developed in the 1950s by General Choi Hong Hi (9<sup>th</sup> degree), known as the Father of Taekwon-Do, and the other pioneers. Since then, it has spread outward from Korea and is now taught across the globe.</p>

			<h2>Our Instructor</h2>
			<p>Daniel Beard (3<sup>rd</sup> degree) started his training under Grand Master Nardizzi (9<sup>th</sup> degree) at the age of just 11. Taekwon-Do quickly became a central part of his life, and since then, he has trained in the art continuously, through both school and university. Despite attaining a degree in Computer Science, Taekwon-Do is where his heart lies, which led him to founding Rise Taekwon-Do in 2024, to pass on his love for the martial art on to others.</p>
			<p>Since the pandemic, he has also become a regular member of the TKD Impact Squad, attending numerous Taekwon-Do competitions each year across the country and in Europe. He is currently the adult England Champion for 3<sup>rd</sup> degree patterns, having won gold at the 2024 English Open Championships.</p>

			<h2>About Taekwon-Do Impact</h2>
			<p>Rise Taekwon-Do is a proud member of Taekwon-Do Impact, a non-profit Taekwon-Do association founded by Grand Master Donato Nardizzi (9<sup>th</sup> degree) in 1996, which is dedicated to improving and proliferating the teaching of Taekwon-Do. By taking the burden of admin away from its clubs, Impact enables its instructors to focus on the more important aspects of running a Taekwon-Do school, namely providing a safe training environment and high-quality teaching for their students.</p>
			<p>There's more to Impact than just paperwork, though; we're a community. As members of Taekwon-Do Impact, Rise Taekwon-Do students have access to frequent events such as seminars and competitions, where they can test their abilities and learn from some of Impact's many highly-experienced instructors. Additionally, Impact coach Jason Ogden (4<sup>th</sup> degree) runs monthly squad training for the Impact Team, who regularly compete in tournaments at the national and international level. Finally, there's our major annual competition, the Impact Open, where the whole Impact family comes together to host a huge, day-long tournament with hundreds of entrants from across the country!</p>

			<h2>About the ITF</h2>
			<p>Through Impact, Rise Taekwon-Do is affiliated with the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). Founded in 1966 by Choi Hong-Hi, the ITF is the body responsible for overseeing the practice of Taekwon-Do worldwide, setting and enforcing the standards for teaching, training and competing, with the aim of ensuring that Taekwon-Do is taught and performed consistently across the globe. The ITF provides advanced training courses for senior black belts, sets the competition rules that most tournaments adhere to and licenses its instructors to teach, but does not take a direct involvement in students' training.</p>
			<p>Our local branch of the ITF, called ITF England, plays a larger role in the day-to-day training of our students. In addition to facilitating cooperation and communication between Taekwon-Do clubs in England, ITF England also hosts its own competitions and seminars, which are open to members of affiliated associations, including Rise Taekwon-Do students. In addition, for those with ambitions in the competitive side of Taekwon-Do, ITF England is responsible for selecting athletes for the national squad, who represent England in the European and World Championships.</p>
